### Battleship

A 1-player (player vs. computer) version of the game Battleship, implemented with Pygame and pygame_gui.

Current status:

- Game engine is not complete (missing ability to place ships)
- Need to implement the computer bot (initial version: computer will randomly place ships, and will guess randomly)
- Game UI is not finalized, need to add descriptive labels

Bonus features:

- randomize ship placements
- improve the bot/AI intelligence (from just guessing randomly)
